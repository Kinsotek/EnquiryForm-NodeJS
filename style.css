    /* You can use CSS selectors to target specific elements */
    /* For example, this rule will apply to all input elements */
    input {
      /* You can use properties and values to change the appearance of elements */
      /* For example, this property will change the width of the input elements */
      width: 80%;
      /* You can also use units such as px (pixels), em (relative to font size), or % (percentage) */
      /* For example, this property will add some space inside the input elements */
      padding: 10px;
      /* You can use colors in different formats such as names, hex codes, or rgb values */
      /* For example, this property will change the background color of the input elements */
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
      /* You can use border properties to change the border size, style, and color of the elements */
      /* For example, this property will add a solid black border of 1 pixel around the input elements */
      border: 1px solid black;
      /* You can use border-radius property to add rounded corners to the elements */
      /* For example, this property will make the corners of the input elements 5 pixels rounded */
      border-radius: 5px;
    }

    /* You can also use pseudo-classes to target elements based on their state */
    /* For example, this rule will apply to input elements when they are focused (clicked on) */
    input:focus {
      /* You can use outline property to remove or change the default outline around the focused elements */
      outline: none;
      /* You can also change other properties to create some visual effects */
      /* For example, this property will change the background color of the focused input elements to light blue */
      background-color: lightblue;
    }

    /* You can also use classes and ids to target specific elements */
    /* For example, this rule will apply to the element with the id of submit-button */
    #submit-button {
      /* You can use font properties to change the font family, size, weight, and style of the text */
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      font-size: 16px;
      font-weight: bold;
      font-style: italic;
      /* You can also use text properties to change the text color, alignment, decoration, and transformation */
      color: white;
      text-align: center;
      text-decoration: none;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      /* You can also use background properties to change the background image, position, size, and repeat of the elements */
      background-image: url('https://i.imgur.com/4Y8bqsc.png');
      background-position: center;
      background-size: cover;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;

    /* You can also use media queries to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices */
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      /* This rule will apply when the screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels */
      input {
        /* For example, this property will change the width of the input elements to 100% when the screen is small */
        width: 100%;
